# Android PdfViewer

Library for displaying PDF documents on Android, with `animations`, `gestures`, `zoom` and `double tap` support.
It uses the build in [PdfRenderer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/pdf/PdfRenderer) for decoding PDF files. Works on API 21 (Android 5.0) and higher.
Licensed under Apache License 2.0.

**Based on [barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer) but without pdfium to avoid increasing the size of your apk/aab. For better performance and a richer feature set, consider using it instead**  


## Installation

Note: The library is not yet available in any public repository. Until then, you have to build it on your own. 

Add to _build.gradle_:

`implementation 'se.aleborn:android-pdf-viewer:1.0.0-beta.1'`


## Include PDFView in your layout

``` xml
<se.aleborn.pdfviewer.PDFView
        android:id="@+id/pdfView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

## Load a PDF file

All available options with default values:
``` java
pdfView.fromUri(Uri)
or
pdfView.fromFile(File)
or
pdfView.fromBytes(byte[])
or
pdfView.fromStream(InputStream) // stream is written to bytearray - native code cannot use Java Streams
or
pdfView.fromSource(DocumentSource)
or
pdfView.fromAsset(String)
    .pages(0, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3) // all pages are displayed by default
    .enableSwipe(true) // allows to block changing pages using swipe
    .swipeHorizontal(false)
    .enableDoubletap(true)
    .defaultPage(0)
    // allows to draw something on the current page, usually visible in the middle of the screen
    .onDraw(onDrawListener)
    // allows to draw something on all pages, separately for every page. Called only for visible pages
    .onDrawAll(onDrawListener)
    .onLoad(onLoadCompleteListener) // called after document is loaded and starts to be rendered
    .onPageChange(onPageChangeListener)
    .onPageScroll(onPageScrollListener)
    .onError(onErrorListener)
    .onPageError(onPageErrorListener)
    .onRender(onRenderListener) // called after document is rendered for the first time
    // called on single tap, return true if handled, false to toggle scroll handle visibility
    .onTap(onTapListener)
    .onLongPress(onLongPressListener)
    .scrollHandle(null)
    .enableAntialiasing(true) // improve rendering a little bit on low-res screens
    // spacing between pages in dp. To define spacing color, set view background
    .spacing(0)
    .autoSpacing(false) // add dynamic spacing to fit each page on its own on the screen
    .pageFitPolicy(FitPolicy.WIDTH) // mode to fit pages in the view
    .fitEachPage(false) // fit each page to the view, else smaller pages are scaled relative to largest page.
    .pageSnap(false) // snap pages to screen boundaries
    .pageFling(false) // make a fling change only a single page like ViewPager
    .nightMode(false) // toggle night mode
    .load();
```

* `pages` is optional, it allows you to filter and order the pages of the PDF as you need

## Scroll handle

Scroll handle is replacement for **ScrollBar** from 1.x branch.

From version 2.1.0 putting **PDFView** in **RelativeLayout** to use **ScrollHandle** is not required, you can use any layout.

To use scroll handle just register it using method `Configurator#scrollHandle()`.
This method accepts implementations of **ScrollHandle** interface.

There is default implementation shipped with AndroidPdfViewer, and you can use it with
`.scrollHandle(new DefaultScrollHandle(this))`.
**DefaultScrollHandle** is placed on the right (when scrolling vertically) or on the bottom (when scrolling horizontally).
By using constructor with second argument (`new DefaultScrollHandle(this, true)`), handle can be placed left or top.

You can also create custom scroll handles, just implement **ScrollHandle** interface.
All methods are documented as Javadoc comments on interface [source](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer/tree/master/android-pdf-viewer/src/main/java/com/github/barteksc/pdfviewer/scroll/ScrollHandle.java).

## Document sources
 _Document sources_, are providers for PDF documents.
Every provider implements **DocumentSource** interface.
Predefined providers are available in **se.aleborn.pdfviewer.source** package and can be used as
samples for creating custom ones.

Predefined providers can be used with shorthand methods:
```
pdfView.fromUri(Uri)
pdfView.fromFile(File)
pdfView.fromBytes(byte[])
pdfView.fromStream(InputStream)
pdfView.fromAsset(String)
```
Custom providers may be used with `pdfView.fromSource(DocumentSource)` method.

## Pages fit policy
Library supports fitting pages into the screen in 3 modes:
* WIDTH - width of widest page is equal to screen width
* HEIGHT - height of highest page is equal to screen height
* BOTH - based on widest and highest pages, every page is scaled to be fully visible on screen

Apart from selected policy, every page is scaled to have size relative to other pages.

Fit policy can be set using `Configurator#pageFitPolicy(FitPolicy)`. Default policy is **WIDTH**.

## Additional options

### Double tap zooming
There are three zoom levels: min (default 1), mid (default 1.75) and max (default 3). On first double tap,
view is zoomed to mid level, on second to max level, and on third returns to min level.
If you are between mid and max levels, double tapping causes zooming to max and so on.

Zoom levels can be changed using following methods:

``` java
void setMinZoom(float zoom);
void setMidZoom(float zoom);
void setMaxZoom(float zoom);
```

## Possible questions

### Why I cannot open PDF from URL?
Downloading files is long running process which must be aware of Activity lifecycle, must support some configuration, 
data cleanup and caching, so creating such module will probably end up as new library.

### How can I show last opened page after configuration change?
You have to store current page number and then set it with `pdfView.defaultPage(page)`, refer to sample app

### How can I fit document to screen width (eg. on orientation change)?
Use `FitPolicy.WIDTH` policy or add following snippet when you want to fit desired page in document with different page sizes:
``` java
Configurator.onRender(new OnRenderListener() {
    @Override
    public void onInitiallyRendered(int pages, float pageWidth, float pageHeight) {
        pdfView.fitToWidth(pageIndex);
    }
});
```

### How can I scroll through single pages like a ViewPager?
You can use a combination of the following settings to get scroll and fling behaviour similar to a ViewPager:
``` java
    .swipeHorizontal(true)
    .pageSnap(true)
    .autoSpacing(true)
    .pageFling(true)
```
